I am a person that writes stuff, sometimes I write code, sometimes I write prose.
My most recent work is within the electricity industry in New Zealand, dealing with building data driven backend systems from a retail perspective, and also a trading perspective. My education is in Engineering Physics from [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
