For the past 3-4 years I have been working for a New Zealand based software company, focused on trying improve energy efficieny of the grid in order to reduce greenhouse gases. A very short and quick recap of areas I worked in are:

- started working on internal dashboards for electricity retail 
- retail company that allowed for peer to peer sharing of electricity, aimed at those with solar panels. Sharing of excess power between customers.
- structure of NZ electricity - generator, lines, retail, etc...
- can we change behavior/habits of residential consumers?
- observing weather patterns for insights into electricity pricing
- hydrology of NZ
- FTR and futures market of electricity
- is there opportunity for a flexibility market, flattening demand curve
- bureaucracy and slowness of the industry
- importance of policy makers

1. Can we get consumers to care about energy?
When something is a given in life, you end up rarely thinking about it, and take it for granted. Electricity is definitely one of those things if you live in a developed world. You expect that flipping the light switch will turn on the lights, that pressing the kettle switch will boil water, the list goes on.
