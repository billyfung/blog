Will 2023 be the year where I post more? Maybe, maybe not...

## New Job

2 and a half years later, I've found myself starting a new job in the new year, so hopefully I will have more to post about. One thing I will reflect on is the job process and interviewing within the last couple months. As the landscape is changing with recession looming and remote working becoming the norm, interviewing has also changed a bit.

 Interviewing is always a crap shoot of the employer trying to figure out who they want, and how they are able to determine that within an interview, and the employee determining if the interview process is even worth the time.
