# Problem solving
This new site is still pretty barren and for quite some time I wasn't sure if I was going to go ahead and switch over. One of the big blockers was the fact that I couldn't easily port my old blog posts over, which makes it look like this blog doesn't have much stuff in it. So that is still pretty high on the list of things to do.

Lately I haven't been hobby programming much, focusing a lot more on being outdoors and running. Since moving to New Zealand, almost 3 years ago, I've increasingly become more obsessed with trail running and being outdoors. Same problem solving, different environment. Endurance sports is like keeping a server with unknown code up and running, you learn lots along the way and figure out different mechanisms to handle it.
